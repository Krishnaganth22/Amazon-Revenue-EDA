This repository contains the analysis of Amazon sales data from March 31 to June 29, 2022. The goal of this analysis was to explore sales trends, clean unorganized data, and derive actionable insights to optimize sales and marketing strategies.

## Overview
  The data spans three months and covers:
  
  Sales across different states and cities in India.
  Product categories and their revenue contributions.
  Temporal trends in sales.
  The analysis revealed key insights into regional, product, and temporal performance that can be used to guide business decisions.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  The raw dataset required significant cleaning and optimization:
  
  Handled Missing Values: Removed or imputed missing data.
  Corrected Spelling Mistakes: Rectified errors in state and city names.
  Removed Unnecessary Columns: Dropped columns that did not add value to the analysis.
  Standardized State Names: Resolved duplicate entries caused by spelling inconsistencies.
## Key Insights
  Top 3 States by Average Sales:
  Ladakh UT
  Nagaland
  Lakshadweep UT
  Amazon has successfully reached remote regions of India, reflecting its broad market penetration.
  Best Month for Revenue: April 2022
  A significant spike in sales during April 14–15, 2022 was observed due to Amazon's Weekend Refresh Sale for Fashion.
  Amazon also introduced Search Volume Data and Add to Cart Data to their Search Query/Catalog Performance Report, which contributed to increased demand.
  Product Performance:
  SET contributed approximately 50% of revenue.
  Kurta and Western Dresses were other top-performing categories.
  Opportunity: Focus on rare sizes like XS to boost sales. For example, an XS-sized SET in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, on April 5, 2022, generated the highest sale amount of     ₹5,584.
## City Insights:
Bangalore is the top-performing city in terms of both orders and revenue.
Low-Revenue Cities: Need to analyze underperforming cities, identify their specific needs, and target them with development initiatives and digital marketing strategies.
# Recommendations
  Target Niche Markets:
  Expand inventory for rare sizes like XS to cater to underserved segments.
  
  Seasonal Sales:
  Use insights from April's success to replicate targeted sales campaigns.
  
  Focus on Low-Revenue Cities:
  Understand challenges and opportunities in underperforming cities. Align strategies with urban development and digital accessibility improvements.
  
  Promote in Remote Areas:
